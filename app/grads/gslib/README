Introduction
------------

This directory contains many of the "basic" scripts I have
written since the mid 1990's and collections from other people.
They are not very well documented and some are likely broken.

The best basic script is:

stdlib.gs

this contains many of the basic functions I use all the time, e.g.,

* time handling in the both grads and the "DTG" format (YYYYMMDDHH)
* meta data and plot dimension
* titling
* script math
* constants


Distribution and Use
--------------------

You have full permission to use and redistribute any of these
scripts.  An acknowledgment would be appreciated and any
feedback welcome.


File Naming Conventions
-----------------------

All my script end in .gs since this is the default extension in
I add to grads, e.g.,

'run myscript.gs'

can be run as

'myscript'

if the GASCRP environment variable is set to the directory where
myscript.gs is located
