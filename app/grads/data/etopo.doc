Sources of Data for the
ETOPO-5 Elevation and Depth Data Set


Ocean Bathymetry -
Comes from the DBDB5 Bathymetry set at NGDC.
The DBDB5 set was derived from various ocean
depth charts and soundings.


Terrestrial Topography Set -

US (excluding Alaska), Europe, and Japan come
from the Defense Mapping Agency (DMA).

Australia and New Zealand data comes directly
from good sources within the countries.

All other data is based on the Fleet Numerical
Oceanographic Center (FNOC) 10 minute elevation
data set.


Comments -

Peter Sloss at NGDC compiled this set.

Higher Resolution sets are available for some
areas and improved sets may become available in
the future through DMA or USGS.
