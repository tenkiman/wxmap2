<h4>23 May, 1998 -- WXMAP to be mothballed 1 June</h4>

<p>

The PCMDI WXMAP web will be discontinued starting 1 June, 1998 due to an
urgent need to redirect computer resources toward mission-critical
projects. 

</p><p>

We regret any inconvenience this may cause and expect to bring the web
back up when Dr. Fiorino returns from assignment in September, 1999, and
when new computer resources may become available.

</p>

<h4>14 March, 1998 -- Mike F. to ECMWF until Sep, 1999</h4>

<p>

I'll be on assignment to the <a href="http://www.ecmwf.int">European
Centre for Medium-range Weather Forecasts</a> for a year and a
half to work on their next reanalysis.

</p><p>

I will make occasional adjustments such as changing the map mix for the
northern Hemisphere tropical cyclone season.

</p><p>

I can be reached at <a
href="mailto:Mike.Fiorino@ecmwf.int">Mike.Fiorino@ecmwf.int</a>,
but as much as you (and I) might like, <b><i>I will <font color=red><u>NOT</u></font>
be adding the ECMWF model to the web</b></i>.


<h4>7 February, 1998 --Docs resources</h4> 

<p>

I'll be out of the country until 25 February. 

</p>


<p>

I've also put up a couple of new docs.  Check out the <a href="wxmap.faq.htm">"WXMAP FAQ"</a>
(Frequently Asked Questions) and <a href="wxmap.www.stat.htm">"WXMAP Stats"</a> (web usage statistics)

</p>



<h4>7 December,1997 -- New map server and processing for NGP</h4>

<p>

The woes of overwritting NGP maps (see <a
href="wxmap.faq.htm">wxmap.faq.htm</a> and unreliability of the
web server and maps should be over.

</p><p>

PCMDI has recently brought on line a new server that is literally
3x faster than any platform I have used in the past to make the
maps.  The combination of more disk space and the "X Virtual
frame buffer" X server will make the web more reliable and
timely.  I am now updating the NGP maps every 20 minutes.

</p><p>

The upshot of all this is that I will be putting out more maps and
areas, stay tuned.

</p>

<h4>25 November, 1997 -- New Areas</h4>

<p>

I've added a big area covering Africa and S. Asia and the Indian
Ocean (IO) at the request of several people.  I'm initially only
putting out the 500 and precip maps, but this can change...

</p>

<p>

I've also added S. America area again, initially only with 500 mb
and precip maps.

</p>

<p>

I've shifted the Whitbread area for the third leg - Freemantle to
Sydney.

</p>

<h4>17 November, 1997 -- New Map - Significant Wave Heights</h4>

<p> I am now receiving 1 degree (same as the models) WAM (Wave
Model) forecasts (there isn't a real "analysis") of significant
wave heights - swell and waves from FNMOC.  My output units are
feet until someone complains.  This field is only available for
the NGP run and in the following areas: Conus, Europe, Asia,
Whitbread, S. America, Africa.

</p>


<h4>3 September, 1997 -- Shift in European Area</h4>

<p>

I rotated the European area a but eastward to cover Isreal at the
request of several people.

</p>

<h4>2 September, 1997 -- t=0 precip and precipitation rate</h4>

<p>

You may have noticed a "t=0" precip map, e.g., in the Europoe AVN home page

<href="http://www-pcmdi.llnl.gov/fiorino/wxmap/avn.europe.htm">
http://www-pcmdi.llnl.gov/fiorino/wxmap/avn.europe.htm</a> is now
available.  This precipitation is NOT observed but comes from the
previous model run and was added for completeness.  For example,
the t=0 precipitation for the 97090212 mmaps come from the 12-h
forecast precip from the 97090200 run of the model.

</p>

<p> One of the most frequently asked questions concerns the
precipitation map.  There are two issues.  What is precipitation
in a numerical model and why I express the precipitation as a
rate [mm/day].  First, precipitation is a byproduct of the model
integration and represents the rain which fell during a two time
periods.  For example, the "t=12" precip in the NGP/MRF is the
rain that fell from t=0 to t=12 h.  That is, the "previous 12-h
precipition".  I take that precipitation (so many mm of water)
and convert it to mm/day (multiply by 2).  I express as a rate
because the models do not "tip the bucket" at the same frequency.
The AVN outputs precipitation every 6 h and the NGP/MRF every 12
h.  By converting to a rate we can intercompare the precipitation
forecast, but to find out how much rain fell, take the rate and
divide by 2 for NGP/MRF to get mm of water during the previous 12
h, or by 4 for the AVN to get mm of water during the previous 6
h.

</p>

<p> I have actually considered getting all the precip forecasts
from the AVN and forming 12-h accumulations as in the MRF/NGP.
Unfortunately, this is a lot of work and in the end would produce
a rate not too different from the 6-h output.  Hence, I will stay
with the rates and let the user decide how to think about the
precipitation.  My personal preference is rate, but at least you
hopefully know how to get back the original data which was
accumulated precipitation during two integration times (12 h for
NGP/MRF and 6 h for AVN).</p>

<h4>12 July, 1997 -- NEW MAPS!!</h4>

<p>

I've added two new maps to the suite: 1) max and min surface air
temperature for the MRF run; and 2) 700 mb streamlines in the
tropical Atlantic and eastern Pacific.  The other significant
change is that the latest MRF run is always on the main page <a
href="http://www-pcmdi.llnl.gov/fiorino/wxmap/wx.htm">
http://www-pcmdi.llnl.gov/fiorino/wxmap/wx.htm</a> or through a
link like <a
href="http://www-pcmdi.llnl.gov/fiorino/wxmap/mrf.conus.htm">
http://www-pcmdi.llnl.gov/fiorino/wxmap/mrf.conus.htm</a>.  I've
also added a bit more intelligence to how the buttons are put on
the map pages so that if you hit the button the chances are
higher the plot will be there.

</p>

<p> The MRF max and min surface air temperature maps need some
explanation before they are used.  Unlike other models, the MRF
saves the max and min surface temperature <b>at each time
step</b> during a 12-h forecast period.  That is, at each grid
point during each 12-h forecast period, the max and min
temperature is output as a diagnostic.  This is NOT the same as
finding the max temperature at each 6-h <b>output</b> period and
is thus reflective of the true model max/min temperature.  I
output every 24-h to get the <b><i>local</b></i> max and min.
</p>

<p> The units are degree F only because I'm used to this unit,
but I can change to Celsius over non-US regions if requested.
</p>

<p> The 700 mb flow map was requested by the hurricane
forecasters at the National Hurrican Center to track easterly
waves coming off Africa.  I shade the N-S wind component ("v"),
in the tropics to help track these waves and I only put out wind
barbs for winds 15 kts and over to avoid clutter.
</p>

<p> I'm only outputing this map in the tropical Atlantic and
eastern North Pacific because of requests.  I can extend to the
western Pacific, etc. if there is interest.  Your comments are
requested.  </p>

<h4>7 July, 1997 -- New Look and Feel -- overhaul of buttons and navigation</h4>

<p>

I've revamped the whole processing structure of the web and have
added many new navigation featrures.  I did this during my annual
two-weeks of active duty with the Navy the <a
href="http://www.nlmoc.navy.mil">Naval Atlantic Meteorology and
Oceanograph Center (NLMOC), Norfolk Va</a> where I rehosted the
web on NLMOC system.  I took this opportunity to overhaul the
driving perl and GrADS scripts and I now have a much easier
system to maintain and extend.  See the <a
href="http://www-pcmdi.llnl.gov/fiorino/wxmap/doc/wxmap.doc.htm">technical
web doc</a> for a fuller description of the system.

</p>

<p> The first obvious change is the main <a
href="http://www-pcmdi.llnl.gov/fiorino/wxmap/wx.htm">home
page</a>.  I took out the java time script and substituted a
status line.  I also added buttons to get you directly to the
<b>model</b> home pages for each <b>area</b> without having to go
to the <b>area</b> home page first.  Hit the model button below
the area icon.  You'll also notice new buttons for documentation
and other resources.

</p>

<p> The <b>area</b> home pages, the main page to get to the maps,
features new time buttons and addition buttons for area-wide
resources such as SST analyses and satellite links.  You can also
point yourself to a specific model and specific area home page by
pointing to:
<br><br>
<pre>
http://www-pcmdi.llnl.gov/fiorino/wxmap/MMM.AAA.htm

where,
   
   MMM = avn | mrf | ngp

         (avn = Aviation run of the NCEP MRF model) 
         (mrf = MRF run of the NCEP MRF model) 
         (ngp = FNMOC NOGAPS run) 
   
   AAA = conus | europe | ausnz | tropwpac | tropepac | troplant

         i.e., the area
or

http://www-pcmdi.llnl.gov/fiorino/wxmap/wx.AAA.htm

to get to the home page for an area


For example,

<a href="http://www-pcmdi.llnl.gov/fiorino/wxmap/ngp.conus.htm">
http://www-pcmdi.llnl.gov/fiorino/wxmap/ngp.conus.htm</a> takes
you to the current NGP maps for CONUS.

and,

<a href="http://www-pcmdi.llnl.gov/fiorino/wxmap/wx.conus.htm">
http://www-pcmdi.llnl.gov/fiorino/wxmap/wx.conus.htm</a> takes you to the current conus home page

</pre>
</p>

<p>

The most striking change will be the maps pages.  I have made
small navigation buttons and put them on the top of the map.  I
did this because some people never say these buttons as they were
on the left and often off the screen.  The new location will
hopefully make it easier to maneuver through the maps.  The other
major change here are new "other map" buttons.  These buttons
allow you to look at the other maps without having to go back to
the home page.  Here are the acronyms:
<pre>
SLP  - Sea level pressure and 700 mb vertical motion
T850 - Temperature, winds and RH at 850 mb
prp  - Precip and thickness
V200 - 200 mb flow and 850-200 shear
V500 - 500 mb flow
Vsfc - Sfc wind and 500 mb height
Tmax - Max surface air temperature (future)
Tmin - Min surface air temperature (future)
V700 - 700 mb flow (future)
</pre>

Note that some of the maps have not been created; they will soon...
</p>


<h4>8 June, 1997 -- Tropical Cyclone and Satellite Button links on maps on the tropical pages</h4>
<p>

I've added two new buttons to the map pages (i.e., individual
maps) in the tropics that point to tropical cyclone (TC) and
Satellite links for that area.  I'm also updating the buttons...

<p>

<h4>5 June, 1997 -- OTIS SST maps are up; New Tropical and Mid-latitude Area ; overhaul of the web s/w; a new marquee and new navigation between analyses</h4>
<p>

As promised below, the OTIS SST analysis and anomalies are up.
I've also added navigation buttons at the analysis time to allow
you to maneuver in time through analyses and not just verifying
forecasts.  This feature is useful for looking for trends in the
tropics.

<p>

The web has been a mess the last two days with many many maps
missing or cross-linked with wrong areas.  The reason was a
complete overhaul of my perl scripts which builds the web and my
GrADS scripts that create the plots.  The overhaul was long overdue and now I can more easily customize and manage the web.

</p>

<p>

I spent a day looking around for a good java applet for a
marquee.  The answer comes from Sweden and is quite nice see <a
href="http://www.algonet.se/~jannea/FunScroll/FunScroll.html">http://www.algonet.se/~jannea/FunScroll/FunScroll.html</a>.
I'll be using this to post new information on the web so get a java-aware browser!.

</p>

<p> At the request of users in New Zealand and here in the
States.  I've put up a new tropical area covering the eastern
North Pacific and a mid-latitude area down under.  Hope you like
them.

</p>

<h4>30 May, 1997 -- Added Two Tropical Areas with Specialized Maps and Drop E. Asia Area for now...</h4>



<p>
The Atlantic tropical cyclone (TC) cyclone season officially opens 1
June and because I'm an old TC guy, I've added two areas
specifically to look at events in the tropics.  The E. Asia area
has been dropped for now, but the new Tropical WESTPAC covers
most of that region.  I plan on restoring that area during the
NHEM winter.

<dl>
<dt>The tropical areas feature three new map types and the precip chart:<dd>

<dd><b>Surface winds and 500 mb heights</b> - The magnitude (kt)
of the surface winds (10 m level) is shaded and wind barbs (kt)
for winds over 8 kts are shown (why 8? because barbs are drawn
every 5 kt).  As the winds go up the barbs change color.  The 500
mb heights are also drawn, but the contour interval and color
changes between the "midlatitudes" (z < 5820, interval = 60 m)
and "tropics" (z >= 5820, interval = 20 m).  The change in
contour interval allows better resolution of mass features in the
tropics <br>

<dd><b>500 mb Flow</b> - This map is same as the midlatitude 500
mb chart except I draw streamlines and add wind barbs (kt).  The
streamlines can better depict details in the 500 flow that is
known to be representive of the "steering" flow<br>

<dd><b>200 mb Flow and 850-200 Shear</b> - The magnitude of the
850-200 wind shear is shaded.  The higher the shear, the less
likely tropical cyclone formation is to occur.  Also high shear
regions are unfavorable for TC development; can reduce intensity
and change the steering flow level.  The green wind barbs
correspond to the 200 mb flow and the red to 850.  The two barbs
visually show the vector shear.<br>


<dd><b>Precip and Sea Level Pressure</b> - This map is the same
as in the midlatitude areas.  Precipitation is the primary energy
source for the tropics and the 2 mb contour interval helps to
better locate tropical distribances<br>


</dl>

These new maps are my first quess at what a TC person might want
to see routinely.  Suggestions for other maps are welcome.  </p>

<p>

The U.S. Navy "OTIS" SST analysis will be coming on line shortly.
This SST analysis is performed every 12 h.  See <a
href="http://metoc-u1.fnmoc.navy.mil/otis/otis.html">http://metoc-u1.fnmoc.navy.mil/otis/otis.html</a>
for another rendition of the data.  The climatology used to
calculate the anomoly is based on the "AMIP II" (Atmospheric
Model Intercomparison Project) <a
href="http://www-pcmdi.llnl.gov/amip2">http://www-pcmdi.llnl.gov/amip2</a>
SST and sea ice concentration observations <a
href="http://www-pcmdi.llnl.gov/amip2/bcs_obs/amip2_bcs.htm">http://www-pcmdi.llnl.gov/amip2/bcs_obs/amip2_bcs.htm</a>
for the period 1979-1996.  The source data for the AMIP II obs
comes from the UKMO Hadley Center GISST2.2a and NCEP Reynolds SST
analyses and is what we believe to be state-of-the are for model
integrations.

</p>

<p>

I have also added movie button the the single map docs and other
buttons will be added for better navigation.

</p>


<h4>3 March, 1997 -- Added SPECIAL Area ...</h4>

<p>

The tropical cyclone email group I belong to began a discussion
about a developing cyclone in the southern Hemisphere making
reference to maps that were not generally available.  I decided
to add a "special" area that will "float" around as interests of
the users dictates.  Suggestions are welcome.

</p>

<h4>12 Dec 1996 -- Extend JAVA Movies to 144 h...</h4>

<p>

I arbitrarily decided to stop the movies at 120 to save memory on
your machine when I first put these out.  However, seeing that
I'm now producing both NOGAPS and MRF maps out 144 h maps, I now
animate the whole set.

</p>

<h4>3 Dec 1996 -- Bug in the MRF precipitation rate...</h4>

<p>

The precipitation rate from the MRF is actually a 12-h
accumulation vice 6 h as in the AVN run.  For example, the
precipitation rate for the 12-h MRF forecast map is based on the
rainfall which fell from t=0 to t=12 h (take this amount in mm and
multiply by 2 to get mm/day).  The "bucket" in the model is then
tipped and accumulation starts again.

</p>

<h4>27 Nov 1996 -- Improved Maps with Sea level Pressure</h4>

<p>

The maps with sea level pressure (precip and slp) have improved
legibility, particularly in high pressure areas.  I also added
700 hPa vertical motion to the SLP and 1000-500hPa thickness
chart.  Let me know what you think...

</p>

<h4>13 Nov 1996 -- Increased the Number of NOGAPS Forecast Maps from 120 h to 144 h</h4>

<p>
A new data flow from FNMOC started today that allows me to make
maps out to 144 hours vice 120 hours.  Use the 12 UTC NOGAPS run
for long-term forecasts (> 72 hour) as the NCEP MRF only runs at 00 UTC.
</p>

<p> 
The available model(s) is now displayed in the PCMDI WXMAP status
table of the <a href="../web/wx.htm">home</a> page.
</p>

<h4>8 Nov 1996 -- Modified <a href="../web/wx.asia.htm">E. Asia</a></h4>

<p>Added <a href="wxmap.help.htm#hints">Hints</a> to the <a href="wxmap.help.htm">help</a> document</p>

<p>I changed the equatorward extent of the E. Asia area to pick up a couple of typhoons</p>

<h4>7 Nov 1996 -- <a href="../web/wxmap.web.archive.htm">Web Archive Link</a></b>
</h4>
<p>

You can now start at any of the previous "webs" available on this
site.  A web is the home page for a particular model run, for
example the integrations made for 00 UTC 7 November, 1996.  I run
a "clean up" utility which current deletes all web material that
is older than 15 days.  This is necessary because of server disk
space limitations.  However, I am archiving the maps on our tape
system...

</p>
<h4>7 Nov 1996 -- Added Resources Button Bar to the <a href="../web/wx.htm">Main Page</a></b>
</h4>
<p>
This button bar will hold new features and links
