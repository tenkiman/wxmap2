1.0	INTRODUCTION

I am now generating real-time weather map graphics using 1 deg
and 2.5 deg data from the Navy's global NWP model called the Navy
Operational Global Atmospheric Prediction System (NOGAPS) run at
Fleet Numerical Meteorology and Oceanography Center (FNMOC).  My
motivation was simple.  I wanted to see how NOGAPS performed on
the two big Atlantic tropical cyclones in September vis-a-vis the
National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) Medium Range
Forecast (MRF) global model as seen in the weather maps at COLA
(http://grads.iges.org/pix/wx.html).  Further, NOGAPS was
occasionally mentioned in the prog discussion at National
Hurricane Center (NHC).

Since putting together the NOGAPS maps, I have set up a data flow
from NCEP to get the data necessary to create the same maps but
for MRF (00 UTC only) and "Aviation" run of the MRF (AVN).  The
MRF completes the 120 h forecast around +8.5 and the AVN (OO and
12 UTC) 72-h forecast is done about +4.5 and my maps should be
out about 45 min. after these events.  

At the request of FNMOC, I have put a time delay on the putting
the NOGAPS maps on the ftp server.  They should be available
about +9 h.

Here is a rough schedule

UTC	PST	EST	Model	Watch

0530	2130	0030	AVN 	00Z
0830	0030	0330	NOGAPS 	00Z
1100	0300	0600	MRF	00Z
1730	0930	1230	AVN	12Z
2230	1430	1730	NOGAPS	12Z

The initial area is generic to the US/Canada and does not cover
the tropics well. However, it is a simple matter to define other
areas should there be interest.

An interactive html interface is being developed now, but in most
browser, you can use ftp of http URLs to locate and display the
images.

2.0	WHERE AND WHAT

The starting URL is:

NOGAPS	ftp://sprite.llnl.gov/pub/fiorino/fnmoc/nogaps/grf
AVN:	ftp://sprite.llnl.gov/pub/fiorino/ncep/avn/grf
MRF:	ftp://sprite.llnl.gov/pub/fiorino/ncep/mrf/grf

or (initially)

NOGAPS	http://www-pcmdi.llnl.gov/fiorino/fnmoc.nogaps.grf
AVN:	http://www-pcmdi.llnl.gov/fiorino/ncep.avn.grf
MRF:	http://www-pcmdi.llnl.gov/fiorino/ncep.mrf.grf

Below each of these are the directories:

archive		-	current and older maps 
current		-	the latest

Below the archive directory you will find subdirectories named
with the "Date-Time-Group" of the run (yymmddhh), e.g.,

96091312 

would be the 12Z 13 September, 1996 run.

Within the directories, I use the file name convention:

MMMRR.PPP.TTT.AAA.gif

where,

MMM 	=	ngp for NOGAPS
MMM 	=	avn for AVN
MMM 	=	mrf for MRF

RR 	= 	10 for 1.0 deg data or 25 for 2.5 deg
		always 10 for the AVN and MRF 

PPP 	= 	plot type

  500 = 500 mb z and vort
  850 = 850 T, V and RH
  prp = precip and slp
  slp = slp + 1000-500 thickness (2.5 deg only)

TTT 	= 	forecast time in hours

AAA 	= 	area

  conus = CONUS (the only one I'm running now, but can do others)

The times displayed in your browser are probably UTC.  

3.0 	PROCESSING

The maps are created using the Grid Analysis and Display System
(GrADS, http://grads.iges.org/grads).  The script is available
upon request.

The map creation process is executed every hour and checks for
data availability and whether the plot has already been made.

Note, the "RH" in the 1.0 deg NOGAPS plots is not really RH, but
an index based on the dewpoint depression.  Specifically,

rhindex = 100 * (ddp-25)/25

where ddp is in deg C.  I hope to get the actual RH soon, but in
the meantime, this seems to work like the 2.5 deg RH.  I will
calculate RH when I start getting the NOGAPS temperature data.

UDPATE: It turned out I had been getting the temperature field so
I now calculate the RH for the 1 deg data using the saturation
vapor pressure calculator used in the NCPE MRF model.
