1.0 	INTRODUCTION

I have completed a "first quess" for an HTML interface to my
operational NWP global model weather maps.

The initial URL is:

http://www-pcmdi.llnl.gov/fiorino/wxmap/wx.htm

for webs from previous watches use,

http://www-pcmdi.llnl.gov/fiorino/wxmap/wx.YYMMDDHH.htm

where YYMMDDHH is the Date Time Group (e.g., 96101600 = 00Z 16
October, 1996).

The documentation is in the works and it's very much alpha, but
hopefully, you'll intuitively figure out what to do.  The buttons
are there to click...

The web emanating from wx.htm is created dynamically, so it won't
be the same from moment to moment.  The number of models changes
according to data availability which, of course, is highly
variable as it depends on the network and various machines...

However, a rough schedule is:

UTC	PST	EST	Model	Watch

0530	2130	0030	AVN 	00Z
0830	0030	0330	NOGAPS 	00Z
1100	0300	0600	MRF	00Z
1830	1030	1330	AVN	12Z
2230	1430	1730	NOGAPS	12Z

Key:

NOGAPS or NGP 	- Navy Operational Global Atmospheric Prediction
		  System of Fleet Numerical Meteorology and
		  Oceanography Center (FNMOC), Monterey, CA

AVN 		- early 72-h run of the U.S. National Centers for
		  Environmental Prediction (NCEP) Medium
		  Range Forecast (MRF) global model

MRF		- long integration of the NCEP MRF model

The delay in the NOGAPS maps is at the request of the Commanding
Officer, FNMOC, but the AVN and MRF maps are created very close
to real time.

The design of the model home pages is very much like COLAs (e.g.,
http://grads.iges.org/pix/avn.fcst.html) and I have borrowed
heavily from their site, including some of their gif files.
While I have fewer maps, the buttons in the boxes really do show
if the map is there (green dot) or not (red dot).  Also, you can
maneuver between models and taus (forecast times).

Please send your comments along and thanks for taking a look.

Mike
