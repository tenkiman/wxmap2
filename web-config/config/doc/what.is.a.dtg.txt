<h1>What's a DTG?<br></h1>

The "DTG" or "Date-Time-Group" is a way of representing time
which I carried over from the days when I worked as a civilian
for the Navy.  I still use it because of it's simplicity.  It's
something you'll have to get used to as it'll appear through out
my weather map web.<br>

Here's the Format:<br><br>

yymmddhh or yyyymmddhh <br><br>
where:<br>

yy = last two digits the year in 1900's or in preparation for the new millenium<br>
yyyy
mm = month number <br>
dd = day number <br>
hh = hour in UTC <br>

<br>
Example,<br>

1996102700 =

00 UTC October, 1996
