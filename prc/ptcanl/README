Information about Michael Natoli's directory on wxmap2

All of my stuff is located in the subdirectory lsdiag. There are
several python codes located in this directory from my work for 
the second half of the summer

- cardanl.py: module with several classes, used by tcanl.py. This
module has several methods to help with reading the storm files 
I created, analyzing them, calculating means, and displaying 
developing and non-developing pTCs. This is a very helpful file
for the display purposes.

- caseSH14.py: this is a script that only displays the Jan 14 
landphoon case against all 2013-15 SH TCs. Options for display.

- casewpac15.py: same as above, but compares the two invests in 
June-July 2015 that had fujiwhara interactions. Options for display.

- data/: subdirectory where I put all of the storm files, i.e. lifetime
tcdiag variables at tau=0 for all of the storms

- diagcard.py: moduke with classes used by tcdiag-mean.py. Useful for 
creating the files that are stored in data of the storm lifetimes

- p.tcdiag-anl.*.py: different versions of a code that parses the 
tcdiag files. Some are my edits, but they come from your original code
so you shouldn't need this.

- tcanl.py: code for displaying everything, options for different listings
and displays. Can display up to 1 season of pTCs in a specific variable mentioned. 
Will automatically correct for gfs2 vs ecmt depending on the year

- tcdiag-anl-card.py: Haven't used this one in a while and it currently doesn't work,
because of some changes I must have made. Not an important one, but i refrained 
from deleting the file. I assume the intent was to print out the diagcards.

- tcdiag-mean.py: Important code, prints out diagcards, prints out means, 
and writes to the data files. Uses diagcard.py module heavily.

- tcdisp4panel.py: displays the pTCs for 4 basins, and gives options on which 
year to use. 

- w2.tc.lsdiag-anl.py: one of your codes. Shouldn't need this either.
