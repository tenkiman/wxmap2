Speedall.for was rewritten from a prior, simpler program, csumanal.for,
written by LCDR Les Carr, because the speedall.for source code was lost
before it could be forwarded to the ATCF software maintainer.

Speedall now:

  explains to the user how to enter the date time groups and which ones
  are available in the aids file,

  offers options to process a range of aids date time groups (for
  post-storm analysis use) or just one, and to process just the most
  recent DTG by default,

  correctly processes both five-tau-converted three tau aids historical
  data with positions missing for 12 and 36 hour taus, and true five tau
  aids data with positions for all five taus,

  presents relative motion from position to position giving both the
  storm's recent observed motion as of the synoptic forecast time, where
  available from the CARQ line, and the storm's forecast motion as
  predicted by each aid,

  handles missing data intelligently, going back as far as CARQ tau -6
  or -12 if necessary (and possible) to find a starting point from which
  to calculate motion, and using the most recent known or forecast
  position across missing data to calculate motion for positions for
  which sufficient position data exists,

  deals as best possible with missing CARQ aid positions at the start of
  storms, by giving relative motion for each of the forecast aid
  positions but the first, and checks for a WRNG aid as an alternate
  source of starting points when available,

  highlights unavailable motion pairs with a "no value" output of 99.9
  knots and 999 degrees, and

  guards against zero divides and other program crash causes.

The first speed and direction pair of each aid's output line is the
observed motion, and the other five pairs are the forecast motion.

To Les Carr's program, I added to the forecast motions an output for the
present storm speed and direction, calculated from the CARQ data, since
it was easy and would act as a reasonableness check on the aids'
forecasts for the end user, and the end user now gets this along with
all five forecast taus' speed/direction pairs in a simple listing broken
down by DTGs.

I also added the ability to ask for a range of date time groups, for the
case where post storm analysis might find this useful, but this should
be the rare case of using speedall.  So, useful defaults exist to avoid
excess typing while still enabling this capability.

Just typing a carriage return at the first DTG prompt starts you off
with the _last_ DTG in the file, since that seems to be the most useful
default.

Just typing a carriage return at the second DTG prompt gets you data for
just the DTG entered for the first DTG prompt, for the case where just
one DTG, but not necessarily the last one, is desired.

So, typing two carriage returns to the DTG prompts is the fast way to
process just the most recent aids downloaded.

You get told all that when you run the program.

Because of the "legacy" (to use the obsolete code maintaining industry's
term of art) converted three tau data, I had to add code to cope with
data missing in the middle of an aid's set of valid position lat/long
pairs.  Speedall now gives a speed calculation wherever the position for
the tau of interest is in the data and there is ANY previous position
available from which to run the calculation.  It uses the most recent
such previous position.

The calculation is seeded from the CARQ aid tau 0, -6, and -12
positions, so if a CARQ aid is missing (and no WRNG aid is available as
a backup, see below), the first (tau 12 or 24, for 5 or 3 valid taus
data respectively) aid position will not get a motion result output for
it, because there won't be a valid earlier position from which to
compute the motion.

Because my software development testing with old storms and no aids
download capability frequently produces DTGs consisting of just WRNG and
JTWC aids with no CARQ aids, there is a careful test to seed from the
WRNG aid's positions instead of the CARQ if it is present but the CARQ
absent for a DTG.  WRNG cards are otherwise ignored, since they are not
really aids and don't use the aids' lines same semantics for the position
fields or intensity fields.

The date time group limits for the aids data files will be shown to you
by speedall (it passes once quickly though the aids file to learn them);
the input data is aids.dat, copied by speed.bat from the current storm's
aids data file, and the output data from speedall comes to the screen and is
also saved in aidspeed.dat, all in \ns_model.
