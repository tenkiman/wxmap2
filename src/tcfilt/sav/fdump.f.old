c        fdump is intended to be replaced by a locally written                  
c        version which produces a symbolic dump.  failing this,                 
c        it should be replaced by a version which prints the                    
c        subprogram nesting list.  note that this dump must be                  
c        printed on each of up to five files, as indicated by the               
c        xgetua routine.  see xsetua and xgetua for details.
