Update Notes:
Notes on update to Version 3.0 (05/15/2015)
   -input.params has had three new parameters added:
      -mnameflag (0/1) - 0:uses the model name(s) specified in the input files
                       - 1:uses the model name specified in input.params
      -logemailflag (0/1) - 1:sends an email with details on completion
      -logemail - email address to send email to when logemailflag is set to 1

   -added handling of all global basins
      -updated gbland.f; added aland.f, shland.f, wland.f
      -updated aland.dat, shland.dat, wland.dat
      -updated recognition of basins and sub-basins in create_diagfiles.sh

   -text parsing tasks have been moved to create_diagfiles.sh
      -removed nameparse.f
      -removed gridparse.f
         -updated handling of grid arrays in inddiag.f
      -removed getcenter.f
         -updated diag_utils.f to remove readADeck() and its dependencies
         -removed dataio.f, dataioparms.inc, dataformats.inc
         -updated totaldiag.f to remove dependecy on upcase()

   -removed all early exit conditions in create_diagfiles.sh
      -script skips case if initial file or track is missing
      -script fills in missing values for forecast time if grid file missing

   -updated Makefile

Notes on update to Version 2.1 (12/31/2012)
   -DELTAT added to NTIME line for consistency (totaldiag.f)

   -added alternate field names to nest wgrib2 calls for consistency
    with parent wgrib2 calls (create_diagfiles.sh)

   -unit conversions for P, T, and SST moved out of lsdiags.f and 
    writeparams() (diag_util.f), and into readgrid() (diag_util.f)
      -lsdiags.f operation is now consistent with introductory comments
       (receives pressure in hPa, temperature and SST in C)

   -framework for including custom (optional) variables updated
      -alterations to inddiag.f, inddiagnull.f, totaldiag.f, lsdiags.f,
       and writeparams() (diag_util.f)

   -custom parameter TGRD added (lsdiags.f, totaldiag.f, diag_util.f)

   -framework for including comments updated to display averaging radii
      -alterations to create_diagfiles.sh, lsdiags.f, totaldiag.f

   -separate radii for TPW added (lsdiags.f)
      -uses 200km in parent grid for calculation (not 500km)

   -updated documentation

Notes on update to Version 2.0 (08/07/2012)
   -intermediate files containing model fields changed from ascii to
    binary (create_diagfiles.sh, readparams() (diag_util.f))

   -alternate model field names added to wgrib2 calls for use with
    global model ensembles

Description:

The current version of the diagnostic code, version 3.0, is set up to 
run off of the HWRF grib2 files.  The create_diagfiles.sh script drives
the system, and is where you would need to concentrate your changes for
accounting for any different file types.  The script delivers binary files
for each field read in and processed by the Fortran diagnostic code.  The 
diagnostic calculations are confined almost entirely to lsdiags.f.  Each
forecast time is dealt with separately, and then combined in the end into
the output diagnostic file.

There are three input files: input.list, input.params, and input.plvls.
-The input.list file contains the absolute addresses of cases to run
 (designated by the parent grid file at forecast time 0).
-The input.plvls file tells the script which pressure levels to look 
 for (and needs to have the same number of levels as specified in 
 input.params).
-The input.params file has ten lines: 
   -the number of pressure levels, 
   -the maximum time (in hrs), 
   -the time interval (in hrs), 
   -the nested flag (1 if nested grid needs to be read; 0 if only 
    one grid), 
   -the model name flag (1 if model name from input.params should be
    printed out in the diagnostic file; 0 if model name derived from 
    filename in input.list should be printed out in diagnostic file),
   -the 4-char model name for printout into the diagnostic file, 
   -the 1-char runtype for writing out the diagnostic filename,
   -the 4-char version for writing out the diagnostic filename,
   -the email logging flag (1 to send email on completion; 0 to not
    send email on completion),
   -and the email address to use if the email flag is set.

Depending on what you will use it for, you may want just the diagnostic
calculations contained in lsdiags.f, or the whole system.

The most common issues with importing this version to different 
modeling groups is that 1) it requires regular lat/lon grids on 
pressure levels and 2) with different models involved different field 
names and unit conversions may be needed.  If you run into any 
problems along those lines email me and I can point you to the 
appropriate places to adjust in the code.

Questions, comments, and suggestions are all appreciated.
